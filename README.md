**Spin up an AI agent company - a business run by AI agents, managed by you.**

Agent Company AI lets a solo entrepreneur create a virtual company staffed entirely by AI agents. Each agent has a specific business role (CEO, CTO, Developer, Marketer, etc.), they collaborate on tasks, and you manage everything through a CLI or web dashboard. Agents can earn real money with built-in Stripe, Gumroad, invoicing, and booking integrations.

> **This fork adds a working chat loop, task execution, and an authenticated
> dashboard (Mission Control).** Chat messages actually run the agents' tools,
> and the dashboard requires login (`admin` / `admin123` on first start —
> change it on first login). No company identity is baked in — you name your
> company at init time.

### Fresh start (recommended, wipes all data)

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh     # one-time: venv + editable install + .env
./scripts/reset.sh     # wipe EVERYTHING and create a fresh company + team
./scripts/run.sh       # start the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8420
```

`reset.sh` destroys old company data (config, db, landing pages, dashboard
logins, wallet keys) and initializes a brand-new company with a default team,
so you can start fresh (data) every time.

### Key Features

- **9 preset roles** — CEO, CTO, Developer, Marketer, Sales, Support, Finance, HR, Project Manager
- **11 LLM providers** — Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, Together, Groq, and more
- **50+ built-in tools** — web search, email, Stripe, Gumroad, invoicing, CRM, landing pages, social media, browser automation, lead prospecting, content generation, webhook notifications
- **Autonomous CEO mode** — set a goal, the CEO plans, delegates, and reviews in cycles
- **Cost safety defaults** — $10/run and $20/day spending caps out of the box
- **Web dashboard** — real-time org chart, kanban board, chat, cost tracker
- **Revenue tracking** — unified ledger across Stripe, Gumroad, invoices, crypto, and manual entries
- **ProfitEngine** — inject your business DNA into every agent's decision-making

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install agent-company-ai
```

Optional extras:

```bash
# Blockchain wallet support (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon)
pip install agent-company-ai[blockchain]

# Development dependencies (pytest, coverage)
pip install agent-company-ai[dev]
```

### 1. Initialize your company

```bash
agent-company-ai init --name "My AI Startup"
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. **Choose an LLM provider** — Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, and more
2. **Configure integrations** — Stripe, Email, Gumroad, Cal.com, Invoices, Landing Pages

The integration menu lets you pick any combination (comma-separated) or select "All":

```
Configure integrations (optional)
  [1] Stripe (payment links & subscriptions)
  [2] Email (send invoices & notifications)
  [3] Gumroad (sell digital products)
  [4] Cal.com (paid bookings)
  [5] Invoices (generate & send invoices)
  [6] Landing Pages (auto-enabled, no key needed)
  [7] All of the above
  [8] Skip for now
```

For each selected integration you'll be prompted for its API key (or press Enter to use an environment variable placeholder like `${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}`).

**Non-interactive mode** (for CI/scripts):

```bash
agent-company-ai init --name "Acme AI" --provider anthropic --api-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

This skips all interactive prompts (LLM and integrations). To skip only integration prompts:

```bash
agent-company-ai init --name "Acme AI" --skip-integrations
```

### 2. One-command setup

Spin up a full team from a preset template:

```bash
agent-company-ai setup tech_startup --name "Acme AI"
agent-company-ai setup saas --name "CloudCo" --provider anthropic --api-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
agent-company-ai setup --list  # see all presets
```

**Available presets:** `tech_startup` (6 agents), `agency` (6), `ecommerce` (7), `saas` (9), `consulting` (6), `content` (5), `full` (10 — all departments)

### 3. Or hire agents individually

```bash
agent-company-ai hire ceo --name Alice
agent-company-ai hire cto --name Bob
agent-company-ai hire developer --name Carol
agent-company-ai hire marketer --name Dave
```

### 4. Define your business model

Tell your agents how the company makes money:

```bash
agent-company-ai profit-engine setup --template saas
```

This injects your business DNA into every agent's decision-making. See [ProfitEngine](#profitengine--business-dna) below.

### 5. Run autonomously

Give the CEO a goal and watch the company run:

```bash
agent-company-ai run "Build a landing page for our new product"
```

The CEO will break down the goal, delegate tasks to the team, and agents will collaborate to deliver results.

```bash
# With limits
agent-company-ai run "Launch MVP" --cycles 3 --timeout 600 --max-tasks 20
```

### 6. Check revenue

```bash
agent-company-ai revenue --days 30
```

## ProfitEngine — Business DNA

ProfitEngine lets you define your company's business model — how it earns money, who it serves, and what matters most. This "business DNA" is injected into **every agent's system prompt** and into the **CEO's goal loop**, so all decisions align with your business model.

### Setup

Start from a preset template or from scratch:

```bash
# Interactive wizard with a preset
agent-company-ai profit-engine setup --template saas

# Fully interactive — choose a template then customize each field
agent-company-ai profit-engine setup
```

The wizard walks you through 8 fields:

| Field | What it defines |
|-------|----------------|
| **Mission** | The company's core purpose |
| **Revenue Streams** | How the company makes money |
| **Target Customers** | Who the ideal customers are |
| **Pricing Model** | How products/services are priced |
| **Competitive Edge** | What sets the company apart |
| **Key Metrics** | What metrics define success |
| **Cost Priorities** | Where money should be spent first |
| **Additional Context** | Any other business context |

### Templates

6 preset templates to start from:

| Template | Business Model |
|----------|---------------|
| `saas` | SaaS (Software as a Service) — recurring subscriptions |
| `ecommerce` | E-Commerce — online retail |
| `marketplace` | Marketplace / Platform — transaction fees |
| `agency` | Agency / Services — project and retainer fees |
| `consulting` | Consulting — advisory and engagement fees |
| `content` | Content / Media — ads, subscriptions, licensing |

```bash
agent-company-ai profit-engine templates  # list all templates
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `profit-engine setup` | Interactive wizard to configure business DNA |
| `profit-engine show` | Display current DNA |
| `profit-engine edit <field>` | Edit a single field |
| `profit-engine templates` | List available preset templates |
| `profit-engine disable` | Disable DNA injection (config preserved) |

### How it works

Once configured, the business DNA is automatically:

- **Appended to every agent's system prompt** — so developers, marketers, sales, and support all understand the business model
- **Injected into the CEO's planning and review tasks** — so autonomous mode goals are planned and evaluated through the lens of your business model

The DNA is stored in `config.yaml` under the `profit_engine` key. No new database tables — just config.

```yaml
# .agent-company-ai/default/config.yaml
profit_engine:
  enabled: true
  mission: "Build and scale a SaaS product..."
  revenue_streams: "Monthly/annual subscriptions..."
  target_customers: "SMB to enterprise..."
  pricing_model: "Tiered subscription pricing..."
  competitive_edge: "Product-led growth..."
  key_metrics: "MRR/ARR, churn rate, LTV:CAC..."
  cost_priorities: "Engineering first..."
  additional_context: ""
```

### Dashboard API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/profit-engine` | Return current ProfitEngine config |
| `POST /api/profit-engine` | Update fields and save to config |
| `GET /api/profit-engine/templates` | List all templates with content |

## Blockchain Wallet

Built-in Ethereum wallet with multi-chain support. Agents can request payments (with human approval), and you can send tokens directly from the CLI.

### Setup

```bash
agent-company-ai wallet create
```

Creates an encrypted keystore (password-protected). One address works across all supported chains.

### Supported Chains

| Chain | Native Token |
|-------|-------------|
| Ethereum | ETH |
| Base | ETH |
| Arbitrum | ETH |
| Polygon | MATIC |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `wallet create` | Generate a new wallet with encrypted keystore |
| `wallet address` | Show the company wallet address |
| `wallet balance` | Show balances across all chains |
| `wallet balance --chain base` | Show balance on a specific chain |
| `wallet send <amount> --to <addr> --chain <chain>` | Send native tokens (requires password) |
| `wallet payments` | Show the payment approval queue |
| `wallet approve <id>` | Approve and send a pending payment |
| `wallet reject <id>` | Reject a pending payment |

### Agent Payments

Agents with wallet tools (`check_balance`, `get_wallet_address`, `list_payments`, `request_payment`) can request payments during task execution. All payment requests go into an approval queue — nothing is sent without your explicit approval.

```bash
# Check pending payments
agent-company-ai wallet payments --status pending

# Approve a payment
agent-company-ai wallet approve abc123

# Reject a payment
agent-company-ai wallet reject abc123
```

### Dashboard API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/wallet/balance` | Balances (optional `?chain=` filter) |
| `GET /api/wallet/address` | Wallet address |
| `GET /api/wallet/payments` | Payment queue (optional `?status=` filter) |

## Multi-Company Support

Run multiple independent companies in the same directory. Each company gets its own config, database, and agents:

```bash
# Default company
agent-company-ai init --name "Acme AI"
agent-company-ai hire ceo --name Alice

# Create a second company
agent-company-ai -C my-startup init --name "My Startup" --provider anthropic
agent-company-ai -C my-startup hire ceo --name Bob

# List all companies
agent-company-ai companies

# Destroy a company
agent-company-ai destroy --company my-startup
agent-company-ai destroy --yes  # destroy default, skip confirmation
```

**Directory layout:**
```
.agent-company-ai/
    default/
        config.yaml
        company.db
        invoices/
        output/
    my-startup/
        config.yaml
        company.db
```

Existing single-company setups are automatically migrated into `default/` on first access.

## Autonomous Mode

The company runs in CEO-driven cycles:

1. **Plan** - CEO breaks the goal into tasks and delegates to the team
2. **Execute** - Agents work on tasks in parallel waves
3. **Review** - CEO evaluates progress and decides: DONE, CONTINUE, or FAILED
4. **Loop** - Repeat until goal achieved or limits reached

When ProfitEngine is enabled, the CEO factors business DNA into every planning and review decision. Incomplete tasks are automatically cancelled (not failed) when the goal loop ends.

**Configurable limits** (in `config.yaml` or via CLI flags):
- `max_cycles: 5` — CEO review loops
- `max_waves_per_cycle: 10` — parallel execution waves per cycle
- `max_total_tasks: 50` — hard cap on tasks
- `max_time_seconds: 3600` — wall-clock timeout
- `max_cost_usd: 10.0` — per-run spending cap ($10 default)
- `daily_budget_usd: 20.0` — rolling 24h budget ($20 default)

## Cost Safety

Agent Company AI ships with safe spending defaults to prevent runaway API costs:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_cost_usd` | **$10.00** | Maximum spend per `run` invocation |
| `daily_budget_usd` | **$20.00** | Rolling 24-hour budget across all runs |

Override via CLI:

```bash
# Set a $5/day budget for this run
agent-company-ai run "Build MVP" --budget 5

# Unlimited (not recommended)
agent-company-ai run "Build MVP" --budget 0
```

Or in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
autonomous:
  max_cost_usd: 10.0      # per-run cap
  daily_budget_usd: 20.0   # rolling 24h cap
```

The cost tracker monitors API usage in real time and stops the autonomous loop when either limit is reached.

## Custom Roles

Create custom roles by adding YAML files:

```yaml
# .agent-company-ai/roles/custom_analyst.yaml
name: analyst
title: "Data Analyst"
description: "Analyzes data and creates reports"
system_prompt: |
  You are a data analyst at {company_name}.
  Your expertise: data analysis, visualization, reporting.
